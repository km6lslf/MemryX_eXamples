# Cartoonizer Using facial-cartoonizer model

The **Cartoonizer** example demonstrates real-time "cartoonization" of a video stream on the MemryX MX3 using an open-source model. This guide provides setup instructions, model details, and necessary code snippets to help you quickly get started.

## Requirements

### Linux

Before running the application, ensure that Python, OpenCV, and the required packages are installed. You can install OpenCV and the pyfakewebcam using the following commands:

```bash
pip install opencv-python pyfakewebcam
```

### Windows

On Windows, first make sure you have installed [Python 3.11](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nrwmjp3717k)ðŸ”—

Then open the `src/python_windows/` folder and double-click on `setup_env.bat`. The script will install all requirements automatically.

## Running the Application

### Step 1: Download Pre-compiled DFP

#### Windows

[Download](https://developer.memryx.com/example_files/cartoonizer.zip) and place the .dfp file in the `python_windows/models/` folder.


#### Linux

To download and unzip the precompiled DFPs, use the following commands:
```bash
wget https://developer.memryx.com/example_files/cartoonizer.zip
mkdir -p models
unzip cartoonizer.zip -d models
```

<details> 
<summary> (Optional) Download and compile the model yourself </summary>
If you prefer, you can download and compile the model rather than using the precompiled model. Download the pretrained model weights (weight.pth) from the FacialCartoonization GitHub repository

```bash
wget https://github.com/SystemErrorWang/FacialCartoonization/blob/master/weight.pth
```

Export the model to ONNX format. To help with the export process, you can refer to the generate_onnx.py script available in the zip folder, which shows you how to convert the model to ONNX format.

You can now use the MemryX Neural Compiler to compile the model and generate the DFP file required by the accelerator:

```bash
mx_nc -v -m facial-cartoonizer_512.onnx --autocrop -c 4
```

Output:
The MemryX compiler will generate dfp file:

* `facial-cartoonizer_512.dfp`: The DFP file for the main section of the model.

Additional Notes:
* `-v`: Enables verbose output, useful for tracking the compilation process.
* `--autocrop`: This option ensures that any unnecessary parts of the ONNX model (such as pre/post-processing not required by the chip) are cropped out.

</details>

### Step 2: Run the Script/Program

With the compiled model, you can now run real-time inference. Below are the examples of how to do this using Python.

To run the example for real-time Cartoonizer using MX3, follow these steps:

Simply execute the following command:

```bash
python run_facial_cartoonizer.py
```
Command-line Options:
You can specify the model path and DFP (Compiled Model) path using the following options:

* `-d` or `--dfp`:  Path to the compiled DFP file (default is models/facial-cartoonizer_512.dfp) or the original model

Example:
To run with a specific model and DFP file, use:

```bash
python run_facial_cartoonizer.py -d <dfp_path> 
```

If no arguments are provided, the script will use the default paths for the model and DFP.

#### Windows

On Windows, you can instead just **double-click the `run.bat` file** instead of invoking the python interpreter on the command line.

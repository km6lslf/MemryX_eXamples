# MxFit - A repcounting web-application

The **MxFit** is a simple web-application based on Yolov8 pose estimation that serves as exercise rep counter. Application showcases the ease of integration with using memryX runtime python API.

## Requirements

Before running the application, ensure that Python and required packages are installed. You can install the required packages using the following command:

The `mx` env created for sdk installation can be used

```bash
. mx/bin/activate
pip install -r freeze

```

## Running the Application

### Step 1: Download Pre-compiled DFP

To download and unzip the precompiled DFPs, use the following commands:
```bash
wget https://developer.memryx.com/example_files/pose_estimation_yolov8.zip
mkdir -p models
unzip pose_estimation_yolov8.zip -d models
```

<details> 
<summary> (Optional) Download and compile the model yourself </summary>
If you prefer, you can download and compile the model rather than using the precompiled model. Download the pre-trained YOLOv8m-pose model and export it to ONNX:

You can use the following code to download the pre-trained yolov8m-pose.pt model and export it to ONNX format:

```bash
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a model
model = YOLO("yolov8m-pose.pt")  # load an official model

# Export the model
model.export(format="onnx")
```

You can now use the MemryX Neural Compiler to compile the model and generate the DFP file required by the accelerator:

```bash
mx_nc -v -m yolov8m-pose.onnx --autocrop -c 4
```

Output:
The MemryX compiler will generate two files:

* `yolov8m-pose.dfp`: The DFP file for the main section of the model.
* `yolov8m-pose_post.onnx`: The ONNX file for the cropped post-processing section of the model.

Additional Notes:
* `-v`: Enables verbose output, useful for tracking the compilation process.
* `--autocrop`: This option ensures that any unnecessary parts of the ONNX model (such as pre/post-processing not required by the chip) are cropped out.

### Step 2: Run the Application

With the compiled model, you can now run the application

Simply execute the following command:

```bash
cd src
python main.py
```
Following output will be printed on the terminal, `ctrl + click` on the link to open the webapp

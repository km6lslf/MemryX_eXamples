## Requirements


Before running the application, ensure that Python, and the `cv2` package are installed:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

## Running the Application (Linux)

### Step 1: Download Pre-compiled DFP

To download and unzip the precompiled DFPs, navigate to `classification_resnet50/assets` and use the following commands:
```bash
wget https://developer.memryx.com/example_files/mlperf_accuracycalc_resnet50_v1.zip
unzip mlperf_accuracycalc_resnet50_v1.zip
```

<details> 
<summary> (Optional) Download and compile the model yourself </summary>
If you prefer, you can download and compile the model rather than using the precompiled model. Download the pre-trained resnet model
 
```bash
wget https://zenodo.org/record/2535873/files/resnet50_v1.pb -O resnet50_v1.pb 
```

You can now use the MemryX Neural Compiler to compile the model and generate the DFP file required by the accelerator:

```bash
mx_nc -v -m resnet50_v1.pb --autocrop -c 4
```

</details>

Your folder structure should now be:

```
|- README.md
|- LICENSE.md
|- assets/
|  |-ImageNet2012_valdata
|     |-ground_truth.txt    
|  |- resnet50_v1.dfp
|  |- resnet50_v1.pb
|
|- src/
|  |- python 
|      |- get_imagenet_valdata.sh
|      |- preprocess.py
|      |- run_validation.py

```


### Step 2: Run the Script/Program 

The application is contained in `src/python/run_validation.py`. It takes two optional arguments:
* `--device` or `-d` - Specifies the device to run the validation on (mxa, cpu). Default is 'mxa'.
* `--count` or `-c`  - Specifies the number of images from the ImageNet2012 to run validation on. Default is 50000.

The model (~98 MB) and ImageNet dataset (~6.8 GB) are downloaded automatically if not found locally. If a pre-compiled DFP are not found, then the model is automatically compiled to generate these. Refer to the `compile_model` function to see how this is done.


To run the application:

```bash
python src/python/run_validation.py   # Runs on MXA
```

Other ways to run:
```bash
python src/python/run_validation.py --device cpu   # Runs on cpu (establish baseline performance)
python src/python/run_validation.py --count 10000  # Runs accuracy for 10000 images instead of 50000 images
```

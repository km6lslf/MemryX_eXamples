## Requirements

List any dependencies or setup steps required to run the example, such as installing specific Python packages or tools.

## Running the Application

### Step 1: Download Pre-compiled DFP

Provide the steps to download the pre-compiled DFP and any related pre- or post-processing models, then extract them to the `models` folder. If no pre-compiled DFP is available, the optional step below becomes the main step, titled **Download and Compile the Model**. For example,

```bash
wget https://developer.memryx.com/example_files/[model_zip_file.zip]
mkdir -p models
unzip [model_zip_file.zip] -d models
```

Replace `[model_zip_file.zip]` with the appropriate ZIP file name for each application. The ZIP file should be named after the applicationâ€™s title.

<summary> (Optional) Download and Compile the Model Yourself </summary>

This is an optional step for users who prefer to download and compile the model themselves rather than using precompiled models. We keep it as a dropdown to streamline the flow. However, if a pre-compiled DFP is not provided, this sub-step becomes **Step 1: Download and Compile the Model**.

### Step 2: Running the Script/Program

Provide example commands for running the application in the different programming languages it's implemented in.

It's a good practice to include command-line arguments in your script wherever possible to make it more user-friendly.

# Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) Using multiple models

The **ALPR** example demonstrates multi-stream real-time object detection using the pre-trained LPD-Yunet model and pre-trained LPR-crnn model on MemryX accelerators. This guide provides setup instructions, model details, and necessary code snippets to help you quickly get started.

## Requirements

For C++ applications, ensure that all memx runtime plugins and utilities libs are installed. For more information on installation, please refer to DevHub pages such as [memx runtime libs installation page](https://developer.memryx.com/docs_dev/get_started/install_driver.html) , and [third party libs installation page](https://developer.memryx.com/docs_dev/tutorials/requirements/installation.html)

```bash
sudo apt-get install memx-accl memx-accl-plugins memx-utils-gui 
```

## Running the Application

### Step 1: Download Pre-compiled DFP

To download and unzip the precompiled DFPs, use the following commands:
```bash
wget https://developer.memryx.com/example_files/automatic_license_plate_recognition.zip
mkdir -p models
unzip automatic_license_plate_recognition.zip -d models
```

### Step 2: Run the Script/Program


#### C++


To run the C++ example using MX3, follow these steps:


1. Build the project using CMake. From the project directory, execute:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

2. Run the application. You can use single camera or provide video file for input.

* To run using the default DFP file and camera as input, simply run:

```bash
# ensure a camera device is connected as default video input is a cam
./singlestream_ALPR
```

* To run with a video file as input:

```bash
./singlestream_ALPR --video_paths vid:<path_to_video_file> 
```

# Vehicle Detection

The **intrusion detection** example demonstrates real-time detection of intruding objects for any desired Region of Interest in a video feed. This can be very useful in video surveillance. ByteTrack has been used for tracking and Yolov8m has been used of the detection of objects

## Requirements

Before running the application, ensure that all **requirements** are installed.

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

### Step 1: Download Pre-compiled DFP

To download and unzip the precompiled DFPs, use the following commands:
```bash
wget https://developer.memryx.com/example_files/intrusion_detection.zip
mkdir -p models
unzip intrusion_detection.zip -d models
```


### Step 2: Running the Script/Program

With the compiled model, you can now run real-time inference. Below are the examples of how to do this using Python.

#### Python

To run the Python example for real-time depth estimation using MX3, simply execute the following command:

```bash
cd src/python
python intrusion_demo.py --input_path ../../assets/surveillance.mp4
```
You can specify the video path with the following options:

* `--input_path`: Path to the video file

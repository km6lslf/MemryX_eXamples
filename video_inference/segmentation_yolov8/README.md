## Requirements

Before running the application, ensure that Python, OpenCV, and the required packages are installed. You can install OpenCV and the Ultralytics package (for YOLO models) using the following commands:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

```bash
pip install ultralytics
```

## Running the Application

### Step 1: Download Pre-compiled DFP

To download and unzip the precompiled DFPs, use the following commands:
```bash
wget https://developer.memryx.com/example_files/segmentation_yolov8.zip
mkdir -p models
unzip segmentation_yolov8.zip -d models
```

<details> 
<summary> (Optional) Download and compile the model yourself </summary>
If you prefer, you can download and compile the model rather than using the precompiled model. Download the pre-trained YOLOv8n-seg model and export it to ONNX:

You can use the following code to download the pre-trained yolov8n-seg.pt model and export it to ONNX format:

```bash
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a model
model = YOLO("yolov8n-seg.pt")  # load an official model

# Export the model
model.export(format="onnx")
```

Additionally, it is essential to simplify the ONNX model by removing unnecessary nodes to ensure smooth compilation. Use the following command:

```bash
python -m onnxsim yolov8n-seg.onnx yolov8n-seg.onnx
```

You can now use the MemryX Neural Compiler to compile the model and generate the DFP file required by the accelerator:

```bash
mx_nc -v -m yolov8n-seg.onnx --autocrop -c 4
```

Output:
The MemryX compiler will generate two files:

* `yolov8n-seg.dfp`: The DFP file for the main section of the model.
* `yolov8n-seg_post.onnx`: The ONNX file for the cropped post-processing section of the model.

Additional Notes:
* `-v`: Enables verbose output, useful for tracking the compilation process.
* `--autocrop`: This option ensures that any unnecessary parts of the ONNX model (such as pre/post-processing not required by the chip) are cropped out.

</details>


### Step 2: Run the Script/Program

With the compiled model, you can now run real-time inference. Below are the examples of how to do this using Python and C++.

#### Python

To run the Python example for real-time Segmentation using MX3, follow these steps:

Simply execute the following command:

```bash
python run_segmentation.py
```
Command-line Options:
You can specify the model path and DFP (Compiled Model) path using the following options:

* `-d` or `--dfp`:  Path to the compiled DFP file (default is models/yolov8n-seg.dfp)
* `-post` or `--post_model`: Path to the post-processing ONNX file generated after compilation (default is models/model_0_yolov8n-seg_post.onnx)

Example:
To run with a specific model and DFP file, use:

```bash
python run_segmentation.py -d <dfp_path> -post <post_processing_onnx_path>
```

If no arguments are provided, the script will use the default paths for the model and DFP.
